## 💡 Inspiration
As vocational students (SMK), we live in two worlds: the stability of **Laravel** taught in school, and the speed of **Next.js** demanded by the industry. Migrating legacy code manually is painful and error-prone. 

**Laraview** was born to solve this. It's not just a syntax translator; it's an intelligent pattern migration engine that understands "The Laravel Way" and refactors it into "The Next.js Way".

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Smart Validation Migration**: Automatically converts Laravel's `$request->validate([...])` into strict **Zod** schemas for runtime safety.
- **🗄️ Eloquent to Prisma**: Intelligent translation of database logic from Eloquent ORM (PHP) to Prisma ORM (TypeScript).
- **⚡ Server Actions Ready**: Generates production-ready functions with `'use server'`, removing the need for manual API route setup.
- **🎨 Developer-First UX**: Built with **Monaco Editor** for a VS Code-like editing experience directly in the browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- **AI Engine**: [Google Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/) via Vercel AI SDK
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Glassmorphism design
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor React
- **Icons**: Lucide React
